# AccaEsseCappaUno

This is a simple application which shows the words required for the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) level 1 exam.
It is based on the starter kit of Sencha Ext JS (6.2 GPL version) with some small changes.
The words list is extracted (thanks!) from the https://www.hsk.academy site.

To see the app locally, after cloning the repo just use the command line:

    sencha app build

or

    sencha app watch

to see "live" effect of your changes.

Enjoy!
